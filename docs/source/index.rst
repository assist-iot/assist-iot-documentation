Welcome to the ASSIST-IoT documentation!
========================================

This ASSIST-IoT repository is used to document the main technical developments of the ASSIST-IoT Project, namely the enablers of the ASSIST-IoT architecture. This documentation will be used as a tool that will help technical personnel and third parties to integrate and use the capabilities of ASSIST-IoT technical outputs and solutions.

The ASSIST-IoT enablers provide functionalities that belong to different planes and verticals and hence, development and internals can be technologically very different among them. In addition, the development and readiness status differ among the enablers. To support that multidimensional approach this wiki is organized with respect to the overall ASSIST-IoT architecture, focusing on each enabler separately. 

Each enabler has its dedicated wiki page organized following a general approach and consisting of the following sections: Introduction, Features, Place in Architecture, User Guide, Prerequisites, Installation, Configuration options, Developer guide, Version control and Release, License, Notice. The current version of the wiki represents the status until M18 and will be updated following the advancements of the enablers.

It is important to stress that the Read the Docs Platform, chosen to host the documentation of ASSIST-IoT, supports continuous and dynamic integration and thus it will be the main public repository that will reflect the progress of the technical developments. More specifically, it is important to highlight that this version of the wiki reflects the enablers' maturity level and developments performed until M18. Since the project is ongoing and additional developments continue to take place in almost all enablers, an updated version of the wiki, depicting the final status of all ASSIST-IoT enablers, will be provided in M30 of the project.
