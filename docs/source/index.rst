Welcome to the ASSIST-IoT documentation!
========================================

This ASSIST-IoT repository is used to document the main technical developments of the ASSIST-IoT Project, 
namely the enablers of the ASSIST-IoT architecture. This documentation will be used as a tool that will help technical personnel 
and third parties to integrate and use the capabilities of ASSIST-IoT technical outputs and solutions.

The ASSIST-IoT enablers provide functionalities that belong to different planes and verticals and hence, 
development and internals can be technologically very different among them. In addition, the development and 
readiness status differ among the enablers. To support that multidimensional approach this wiki is organized 
with respect to the overall ASSIST-IoT architecture, focusing on each enabler separately. 

Each enabler has its dedicated wiki page organized following a general approach and consisting of the following sections: 
Introduction, Features, Place in Architecture, User Guide, Prerequisites, Installation, Configuration options, 
Developer guide, Version control and Release, License, Notice. 

The current version of the wiki represents the latest updated status of the documentation.


**You can also access other versions of the documentation:**

    - The documentation in the `month 18 <https://assist-iot-enablers-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/m18/index.html>`_ of the project.
    - The documentation in the `month 30 <https://assist-iot-enablers-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/m30/index.html>`_ of the project.
    - The  `latest <https://assist-iot-enablers-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ documentation in the of the project, which is the current page.




It is important to stress that the Read the Docs Platform, chosen to host the documentation of ASSIST-IoT, 
supports continuous and dynamic integration and thus it will be the main public repository that will reflect 
the progress of the technical developments. 

Since the project is ongoing and additional developments continue to take place in almost all enablers, 
an updated version of the wiki, depicting the final status of all ASSIST-IoT enablers, will be provided in the end of the project.
