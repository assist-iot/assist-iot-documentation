***************
Introduction
***************
This enabler will foster the use of DLT-related components to exchange the local, on-device models (or model gradients) in a decentralised way. 

***************
Features
***************
The DLT can act as a component to manage AI contex-tual information and prevent any alteration to the data. The alteration of data is a threat to the Fed-erated Learning approach and the DLT can help in mitigating the threat. Moreover, the enabler will allow mitigating single-point of failures. Finally, the enabler can be charged with validating the in-dividually trained models to rule out malicious updates that can harm the global model.
