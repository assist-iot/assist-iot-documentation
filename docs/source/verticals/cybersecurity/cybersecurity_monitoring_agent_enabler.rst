Introduction
***************
Perform functions of an endpoint detection and response system, monitoring and collecting activity from end points that could indicate a threat. Security agent runs at a host-level, combining anomaly and signature-based technologies to detect intrusions or software misuse.

***************
Features
***************


All agent modules have different purposes and settings. Here is a brief description of what they do:


- **Log collector:**

    This agent component can read flat log files and Windows events, collecting operating system and application log messages. It does support XPath filters for
    Windows events and recognizes multi-line formats (e.g. Linux Audit logs). It can also enrich JSON events with additional metadata.


- **Command execution:**

    Agents can run authorized commands periodically, collecting their output and reporting it back to the Wazuh server for further analysis. This module can be used to
    meet different purposes (e.g. monitoring hard disk space left, getting a list of last logged in users, etc.).


- **File integrity monitoring (FIM):**


    This module monitors the file system, reporting when files are created, deleted, or modified. It keeps track of file attributes, permissions, ownership, and
    content. When an event occurs, it captures who, what, and when details in real time. Additionally, this module builds and maintains a database with the state of
    the monitored files, allowing queries to be run remotely.


- **Security configuration assessment (SCA):**


    This component provides continuous configuration assessment, utilizing out-of-the-box checks based on the Center of Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks. Users can
    also create their own SCA checks to monitor and enforce their security policies.


- **System inventory:**

    This agent module periodically runs scans, collecting inventory data such as operating system version, network interfaces, running processes, installed
    applications, and a list of open ports. Scan results are stored into local SQLite databases that can be queried remotely.


- **Malware detection:**

    Using a non-signature based approach, this component is capable of detecting anomalies and possible presence of rootkits. Monitoring system calls, it looks for
    hidden processes, hidden files, and hidden ports.


- **Active response:**

    This module runs automatic actions when threats are detected. Among other things, it can block a network connection, stop a running process, or delete a malicious
    file. Custom responses can also be created by users when necessary (e.g. run a binary in a sandbox, capture a network connection traffic, scan a file with an
    antivirus, etc.).


- **Containers security monitoring:**

    This agent module is integrated with the Docker Engine API in order to monitor changes in a containerized environment. For example, it detects changes to container
    images, network configuration, or data volumes. Besides, it alerts on containers running in privileged mode and on users executing commands in a running container.


- **Cloud security monitoring:**


    This component monitors cloud providers such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google GCP. It natively communicates with their APIs. It is capable of detecting
    changes to the cloud infrastructure (e.g. a new user is created, a security group is modified, a cloud instance is stopped, etc.), and collecting cloud services
    log data (e.g. AWS Cloudtrail, AWS Macie, AWS GuardDuty, Azure Active Directory, etc.)

Developer guide
***************

The Cybersecurity monitoring agent enabler only interacts with the cybersecurity monitoring. This enabler is installed in each physical system that we want to protect and collects info from the OS and network and send I to the monitoring system.

There are two methods for enrolling an agent to the manager server: 

1.	Enrollment via agent configuration: Once the IP address of the manager has been set, the agent will be able to automatically request the key and import it (Recommended).

The Wazuh manager IP address on the agent can be configured in one of two ways:

â€¢	Using environment variables during the agent installation process.

â€¢	Manually configuring the Wazuh manager IP address in the agent configuration file.


2.	Enrollment via manager API: The user requests the key from the manager API and then manually imports it to the agent.
Using this option, the steps to follow are these ones:

a)	The user sends an API request with the manager API credentials to generate an authorization token (a JSON Web Token).

TOKEN=$(curl -u <user>:<password> -k -X POST "https://<MANAGER_IP>:55000/security/user/authenticate?raw=true")

b)	The user sends an API request with the authorization token to the Wazuh manager. This request enrolls the agent and gets the agent key. You must specify the desired agent name instead of <agent_name>.

curl -k -X POST -d '{"name":"<agent_name>"}' "https://<MANAGER_IP>:55000/agents?pretty=true" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

c)	On the agent endpoint, the user imports the key to the agent.

d)	The user configures the Wazuh manager IP address on the agent.

e)	The user restarts the agent and then the connection to the manager is established.

You must ensure the outbound connectivity from the Wazuh agent to the Wazuh manager services.

1514/TCP for agent communication.

1515/TCP for enrollment via automatic agent request.

55000/TCP for enrollment via manager API.
